Perfect — here’s a conclusive, structured, and comprehensive workflow for your Smart Personalized Shopping Assistant project using Option B (sentence embeddings + cosine similarity). This is ready for team execution, documentation, and presentation.

🧠 Project Goal
Enhance product discovery by using ML-powered semantic understanding to recommend products that best match user intent, preferences, and budget.

🚀 What Makes It “Emerging Tech”?
Using a pretrained transformer to extract sentence-level semantic meaning from queries and product data — this is something keyword search cannot do.

📌 High-Level Architecture

Frontend (React) ⟶ Backend API (FastAPI) ⟶ ML Layer (SentenceTransformer) ⟶ Product Data (CSV/JSON)
             ⬑ Cosine Similarity Matching & Scoring

─────────────────────────────

🧾 Step-by-Step Workflow

PHASE 1: User Interaction (Frontend)

User fills a form with:

Product category (dropdown)

Keywords / natural language query (text)

Budget range (slider)

Preferred brands (checkboxes)

Frontend sends POST request to /recommend_products API with user inputs.

Example request:
{
"category": "laptop",
"query": "i7 processor, lightweight, good battery",
"budget": [50000, 75000],
"brands": ["Dell", "HP"]
}

 

PHASE 2: Request Handling (Backend – FastAPI)

Receive user inputs in FastAPI.

Filter product catalog (CSV or database) by:

category match

price within budget

optionally: in-stock flag

 

PHASE 3: ML-Powered Recommendation Logic

Preprocess all filtered product entries:

Combine product title + features/description into a text string.

Use SentenceTransformer (e.g. all-MiniLM-L6-v2):

Encode user query to vector (1x384)

Encode each product’s description to vector (Nx384)

Use cosine similarity to compare:

similarity = cos(user_vector, product_vector)

Output a similarity score (0–1) for each product

(Optional) Add bonus weights:

+0.05 if brand matches preferred list

+0.03 if product rating ≥ 4.0

Sort all results by total similarity score (descending)

 

PHASE 4: Response (API → Frontend)

Format top N products with:

Title, image URL, price, brand, rating, short description

Matching reasons (e.g. "Strong semantic match + preferred brand")

Return JSON response to frontend.

 

PHASE 5: UI Output (Frontend)

Render a responsive grid or card layout:

Show top N recommendations

For each card: product image, title, price, badge (why we picked this)

Optional: toggle to show match % or explanations

Include a “Refine Your Search” panel to update inputs and re-run.

🔌 Libraries You’ll Use

Backend (Python):

fastapi

sentence-transformers

pandas / numpy

scikit-learn (optional, for fallback logic)

Frontend:

React / Next.js

Tailwind CSS (optional for styling)

Axios for API requests

 

📊 Sample Product Data Schema (CSV)

product_id	title	price	brand	rating	features	image_url
1	HP Pavilion 14	67000	HP	4.2	Lightweight laptop with i7 CPU	...
2	Dell Inspiron 15	60000	Dell	4.1	i5, SSD, long battery life	...

 

🧪 Testing Plan

Try sample queries: “light laptop for office use”, “gaming laptop under 70k”

Test edge cases: no matches, multiple similar products, etc.

Confirm that relevant items show up even if keyword not exact

 

🚀 Deployment (Optional)

Frontend: Vercel / Netlify

Backend: Render / Railway / HuggingFace Spaces

Or host both on one full-stack container

 

📈 Pitch Talking Points (for judging)

“We use real ML — not just keyword search — to understand user intent.”

“The assistant learns product semantics using transformers.”

“It gives more intelligent, personalized product suggestions than a basic search box.”
